Snap To Grid - Fast & Easy Positioning
v1.1 - Released 10/06/2017 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for your purchase of Snap To Grid. Snap To Grid makes positioning objects in the Unity editor much easier and faster. You can snap while in Move, Rotate and Scale modes and to make things even faster you can use the quick transform buttons. The program also includes a handy feature to snap to the terrain height.  	 

Snap To Grid has been designed to support both Metric and Imperial units, including both degrees and radians. You can select the Metric and Imperial units from a convenient drop down list and even enter custom values in a text box.

I hope you find the program easy to use and if you have a problem, question or a suggestion please contact me at support@meshmaker.com


Notes
----------------------------------------
In Unity 5 it is recommended to turn of continuous baking of lightmaps by going to the menu and navigating to Window/Lighting/Lightmaps and unchecking the checkbox. This will prevent lag and stuttering in the editor.


Todo List.
----------------------------------------
This program is an early release and there are a lot of possibilities for improving the snapping.

If you have a specific request please let me know and I'll try to add them to the feature list.
